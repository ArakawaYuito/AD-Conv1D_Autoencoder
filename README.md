# Conv1D Autoencoder
Anomaly Detection with Conv1D Autoencoder. Same basic structure of traditional Autoencoder but the fully-connected layers is replaced with convolutional layers. The convolutional layer effectively extracts local features such as short-term patterns and sudden changes in time-series data.
